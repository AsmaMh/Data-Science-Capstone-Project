## Data Used

I will use the FourSquare API to collect data about locations in 5 major US cities which are: New York,NY, San Francisco, CA, Jersey City, NJ, Boston, MA and Chicago,IL. These are one of the most populated US cities and I am hopeful that I will find a best suitable place to start a Pizz-eria Restaurant.
