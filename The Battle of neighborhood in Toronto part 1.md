# In search of a place to start a yummiable pizza restaurant?


## Introduction

Let say I am planning to open a new restaurant in US.So I want to explore places in US and check the areas where pizza restaurant is not available.The aim is to solve and  to analyze the Pizza stores locations in the major US cities and find the best place for our tourist so that he can have a good pizza-ourism.I need to open a restaurant in busy area where people often move around.

## Data section


I will use the FourSquare API to collect data about locations in 5 major US cities which are: New York,NY, San Francisco, CA, Jersey City, NJ, Boston, MA and Chicago,IL. These are one of the most populated US cities and I am hopeful that I will find a best suitable place to start a Pizz-eria Restaurant.
